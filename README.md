# Alexandre AUBERT - Portfolio

This portfolio is a showcase of my work and skills. It is built using Angular. You'll find here a list of my competencies, achievements, projects, inspirations from my library and a contact form.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via Jest (with coverage)

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

Master branch is automatically deployed using GitHub Actions
